## VPC And Subnets Primer

- VPC: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
- A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
- A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

## Internet Gateway And NAT Gateways

- **Internet Gateways** helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
- **NAT Gateways** (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your **Private Subnets** to access the internet while remaining private

## Network ACL And Security Groups

- NACL (Network ACL)
  - A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
  - Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
  - Are attached at the Subnet level
  - Rules only include IP addresses
- Security Groups
  - A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
  - Can have only ALLOW rules
  - Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

### Network ACLs vs Security Groups

| Security Group                                                                                                                                              | Network ACL                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operates at the instance level                                                                                                                              | Operates at the subnet level                                                                                                                          |
| Supports allow rules only                                                                                                                                   | Supports allow rules and deny rules                                                                                                                   |
| Is stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules                                                                               | Is stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules                                                                                      |
| We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic                                                                                              | We process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic                                                                               |
| Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group when launching the instance,or associates the security group with the instance later on | Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with (therefore, you don't have to rely on users to specify the security group) |

## VPC Flow Logs

- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - Subnet Flow Logs
  - Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
- Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
  - Subnets to internet
  - Subnets to subnets
  - Internet to subnets
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
- VPC Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs

## VPC Peering

- Connect two VPC, privately using AWSâ€™ network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
- VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

## VPC Endpoints

â€¢ Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services **using a private network** instead of the public www network
â€¢ This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
â€¢ VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
â€¢ VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest
â€¢ **Only used within your VPC**

## Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect

- Site to Site VPN
  - Connectanon-premisesVPNtoAWS
  - The connection is automatically encrypted
  - Goes over the public internet
- Direct Connect (DX)
  - Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
  - The connection is private, secure and fast
  - Goes over a private network
  - Takes at least a month to establish
- **Note: Site-to-site VPN and Direct Connect cannot access VPC endpoints**

## VPC Summary

- VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
- Subnets: Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
- Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
- NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
- NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
- Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
- VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, non transitive
- VPC Endpoints: Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
- VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
- Site to Site VPN: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS â€¢ Direct Connect: direct private connection to a AWS
