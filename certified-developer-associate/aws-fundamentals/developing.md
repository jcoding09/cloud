## AWS CLI Dry Runs

- Sometimes, we‚Äôd just like to make sure we have the permissions...
- But not actually run the commands!
- Some AWS CLI commands (such as EC2) can become expensive if they succeed, say if we wanted to try to create an EC2 Instance
- Some AWS CLI commands (not all) contain a --dry-run option to simulate API calls

## AWS CLI STS Decode Errors

- When you run API calls and they fail, you can get a long error message
- This error message can be decoded using the **STS** command line:
- sts **decode-authorization-message**

## AWS EC2 Instance Metadata

- AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is powerful but one of the least known features to developers
- It allows AWS EC2 instances to ‚Äùlearn about themselves‚Äù **without using an IAM Role for that purpose.**
- The URL is <http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data>
- You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you CANNOT retrieve the IAM Policy.
- Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
- Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instance

## MFA with CLI

- To use MFA with the CLI, you must create a temporary session
- To do so, you must run the **STS GetSessionToken** API call
- **aws sts get-session-token** --serial-number arn-of-the-mfa-device --token-code code-from-token --duration-seconds 3600

  ```json
  {
    "Credentials": {
      "SecretAccessKey": "secret-access-key",
      "SessionToken": "temporary-session-token",
      "Expiration": "expiration-date-time",
      "AccessKeyId": "access-key-id"
    }
  }
  ```

## AWS SDK Overview

- What if you want to perform actions on AWS directly from your applications code ? (without using the CLI).
- You can use an SDK (software development kit) !
- Official SDKs are...
  - Java
  - .NET
  - Node.js
  - PHP
  - Python (named boto3 / botocore)
  - Go
  - Ruby
  - C++
- We have to use the AWS SDK when coding against AWS Services such as DynamoDB
- Fun fact... the AWS CLI uses the Python SDK (boto3)
- The exam expects you to know when you should use an SDK
- We‚Äôll practice the AWS SDK when we get to the Lambda functions
- **Good to know:** if you don‚Äôt specify or configure a default region, then us-east-1 will be chosen by default

## AWS Limits (Quotas)

- **API Rate Limits**
  - DescribeInstances API for EC2 has a limit of 100 calls per seconds
  - GetObject on S3 has a limit of 5500 GET per second per prefix ‚Ä¢ For Intermittent Errors: implement Exponential Backoff
  - For Consistent Errors: request an API throttling limit increase
- **Service Quotas (Service Limits)**
  - Running On-Demand Standard Instances: 1152 vCPU
  - You can request a service limit increase by opening a ticket
  - You can request a service quota increase by using the Service Quotas API

## Exponential Backoff (any AWS service)

- If you get ThrottlingException intermittently, use exponential backoff
- Retry mechanism already included in AWS SDK API calls
- Must implement yourself if using the AWS API as-is or in specific cases
  - Must only implement the retries on **5xx server errors** and throttling
  - Do not implement on the 4xx client errors

## AWS CLI Credentials Provider Chain

- The CLI will look for credentials in this order

1. Command line options ‚Äì --region, --output, and --profile
2. Environment variables ‚Äì AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
3. CLI credentials file ‚Äìaws configure ~/.aws/credentials on Linux / Mac & C:\Users\user\.aws\credentials on Windows
4. CLI configuration file ‚Äì aws configure ~/.aws/config on Linux / macOS & C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config on Windows
5. Container credentials ‚Äì for ECS tasks
6. Instance profile credentials ‚Äì for EC2 Instance Profiles

## AWS Credentials Best Practices

- Overall, NEVER EVER STORE AWS CREDENTIALS IN YOUR CODE
- Best practice is for credentials to be inherited from the credentials chain
- If using working within AWS, use IAM Roles
  - => EC2 Instances Roles for EC2 Instances
  - => ECS Roles for ECS tasks
  - => Lambda Roles for Lambda functions
- If working outside of AWS, use environment variables / named profiles
